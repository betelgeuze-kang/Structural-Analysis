# Structural Native Workspace

This workspace is the staged Rust/C++ product boundary. Slice A implements the CPU-only
build graph and C ABI v1 foundation. Slice B adds strict Rust `ModelIR` v2 wire decoding,
Draft 2020-12 schema validation, Python-compatible canonical bytes and three SHA-256
identities. Slice C adds the ABI v1.1 typed descriptor, immutable C++ semantic owner,
deterministic validation report and caller-owned canonical snapshot. The safe Rust round-trip,
ABI v1.1 RAII owner and `structural-cli model validate` then complete Slice D and promote the
bounded ModelIR domain to C3. Frame Alpha appends ABI v1.2 with a bounded CPU-only linear
Timoshenko Frame3D compile/solve path, raw and safe Rust bindings, and independent Python
six-mode plus rotated multi-member parity at C1. HIP parity, ModelIR-to-analysis composition,
restart, ResultIR/ReportIR product E2E and Workbench remain unimplemented;
`capabilities.json` records that boundary.

## Rust

~~~bash
cargo fmt --manifest-path native/Cargo.toml --all -- --check
cargo clippy --manifest-path native/Cargo.toml --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test --manifest-path native/Cargo.toml --workspace --locked
cargo +1.77.0 check --manifest-path native/Cargo.toml --workspace --all-targets --locked
~~~

`structural-ffi` is the only crate that configures and links the C++ library. The other crates
must not run a second CMake build.

`structural-contracts` packages its own byte-identical transition copy of the Python-oracle
`ModelIR` v2 schema. A focused test blocks silent drift between the two copies. The C1
capability covers wire/schema/canonical identity only, not C++ semantics or solver readiness.

The `modelir_v2_cpp_core` capability remains narrower than aggregate `modelir_v2`: Slice C
introduced it at C0 and Slice D's Python semantic parity advances it to C1. Slice D's C3 aggregate
adds the exhaustive Rust descriptor arena, safe RAII ownership, concurrent immutable queries,
eight-fixture byte/hash round-trip and the validation CLI. Semantic invalidity is returned in the
versioned report; it is not disguised as an ABI create failure. Explicit blockers fail only when
the CLI's `--require-analysis-ready` policy is selected.

The validation-only product command is:

~~~bash
cargo run --manifest-path native/Cargo.toml -p structural-cli -- \
  model validate tests/fixtures/model_ir_v2/frame_cantilever_all_modes.json \
  --require-analysis-ready
~~~

Without `--require-analysis-ready`, a contract-valid document with explicit blockers exits zero
while preserving `analysis_ready: false` in the report. Semantic or wire invalidity exits 2;
runtime/input transfer failure exits 1.

The Frame Alpha surface is intentionally narrower than a product analysis workflow. It accepts
2-16 nodes, 1-32 prismatic members and no more than 60 free equations; supports fixed restrained
DOFs, local-axis roll and linear elastic Timoshenko stiffness; and returns global displacement,
global reaction and member-local end-force vectors. It rejects duplicate/parallel members,
disconnected graphs, prescribed nonzero supports, releases, offsets, distributed loads,
nonlinear behavior and oversized models. The API is reached through `Api::load_frame3d()` and a
unique Rust RAII model owner. These C0/C1 checks do not establish HIP parity, broad engineering
validation, ResultIR authority, public Workbench execution or release approval.

## CPU-only C++

~~~bash
cmake -S native/cpp -B build/native \
  -DSTRUCTURAL_BUILD_TESTS=ON \
  -DSTRUCTURAL_ENABLE_HIP=OFF \
  -DSTRUCTURAL_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS=ON
cmake --build build/native --parallel
ctest --test-dir build/native --output-on-failure
~~~

`STRUCTURAL_ENABLE_HIP=ON` is opt-in and fails configuration unless a HIP compiler and an
explicit `CMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES` target are available. CPU-only configuration never probes
or links ROCm.

## Installable package

`cmake --install` installs the C11/C++20 header, static or shared `structural_c_abi_v1`
library, CMake package targets and `structural-native-build.json`. The only public shared
library symbol remains `sa_get_api_v1`; ABI v1.1 ModelIR and ABI v1.2 Frame3D operations are
negotiated through its append-only 128-byte table.

The old probe crates remain outside this workspace. Their preservation and next migration
owner are recorded in `compatibility-owners.json`; no legacy symbol is removed by Slice A.
